## Installation

**NOTE**: NodeJS 10.13.0 or higher is required.

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/EsteveSegura/twitch-bot-analysis.git

# change the working directory to twitch-bot-analysis
$ cd twitch-bot-analysis

# install NodeJS & npm if they are not installed

# install the requirements
$ npm install
```


## Configuration 
The configuration is simple, there is a file with the name config.json, it is the file that we must edit so that our program works correctly

The file is located in the following path : ``./src/config.json``

``` JSON
{
     "target" : "GiRLaZo"
}
```

**target :** This is the property in which we must introduce the twitch channel of our target

## Usage
The use is easy, we just have to navigate to our **src folder** and launch the following command
``` bash
$ cd src && node index.js
```

## How does it work
The application has different mechanisms that are **triggered every 5 minutes**. Analyze the views that come from users registered on twitch and from "ghost" views not registered on the platform. It also takes screenshots and **collects the entire chat.**

**This data is collected when the streamer target transmission begins and is saved in json files once the transmission ends.**

_Captures are saved every 5 minutes *_
